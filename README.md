# Monitoring Kubernetes Pods & Containers

A PoC project to display Kubernetes pod and container information in a web UI.
The goal was to extract pod IPs and statuses from Kubernetes API. 

The next step would be to enhance this basic information with application specific
data. For example, add Elasticsearch cluster status (green, yellow, red).

Few screenshots are shown below.
